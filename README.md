### BPMN

### Patterns


- Authentication Broker - basically we have a separate service that issues tokens to clients and it makes sure that they only users with tokens access the resources available on the server

- Service Fa√ßade - provides loose coupling between a service requester and functionality that is provided by an application or capability that is not service-enabled. The loose coupling conceals the complexities of the provider and presents a standard web service interface

### How to use

To start the server:
1. run docker-compose build
2. run docker-compose up

To start the client:
1. npm i
2. ng serve
