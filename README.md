### BPMN

### Patterns:


- Authentication Broker - basically we have a separate service that issues tokens to clients and it makes sure that they only users with tokens access the resources available on the server

- Service Fa√ßade - provides loose coupling between a service requester and functionality that is provided by an application or capability that is not service-enabled. The loose coupling conceals the complexities of the provider and presents a standard web service interface
